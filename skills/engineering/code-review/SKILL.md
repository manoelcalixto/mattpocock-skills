description: "Review one stable checkpoint since a fixed point (commit, branch, tag, or merge-base) along two axes: Standards (does the code follow this repo's documented coding standards?) and Spec (does the code match what the originating issue/spec asked for?). Runs both reviews in parallel sub-agents and reports them side by side. Use when the user wants to review a branch, a PR, work-in-progress changes, or asks to \"review since X\"."
---

Two-axis review of one logical **review checkpoint**: a completed implementation batch compared with a fixed point the user supplies. Each pass pins the exact head SHA it reviews.

- **Standards**: does the code conform to this repo's documented coding standards?
- **Spec**: does the code faithfully implement the originating issue / spec?

Both axes run as **parallel sub-agents** so they don't pollute each other's context, then this skill aggregates their findings. One initial pass completes the checkpoint. Commits that apply its findings remain part of that checkpoint and do not start another review automatically.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

## Process

### 1. Pin the fixed point and checkpoint

Whatever the user said is the fixed point (a commit SHA, branch name, tag, `main`, `HEAD~5`, etc.). If they didn't specify one, ask for it.

Resolve `HEAD` to an exact SHA and keep that SHA for the whole pass. Capture the diff command once: `git diff <fixed-point>...<head-sha>` (three-dot, so the comparison is against the merge-base). Also note the list of commits via `git log <fixed-point>..<head-sha> --oneline`.

Before going further, confirm the fixed point and head SHA resolve and the diff is non-empty. A bad ref or empty diff should fail here, not inside two parallel sub-agents. Use the exact head SHA even if the branch moves while the review runs. A bounded follow-up keeps the original fixed point, pins the new head SHA, and reviews the full `<fixed-point>...<new-head-sha>` diff.

### 2. Identify the spec source

Look for the originating spec, in this order:

1. Issue references in the commit messages (`#123`, `Closes #45`, GitLab `!67`, etc.), fetched via the workflow in `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.
2. A path the user passed as an argument.
3. A spec file under `docs/`, `specs/`, or `.scratch/` matching the branch name or feature.
4. If nothing is found, ask the user where the spec is. If they say there isn't one, the **Spec** sub-agent will skip and report "no spec available".

### 3. Identify the standards sources

Anything in the repo that documents how code should be written, such as `CODING_STANDARDS.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

On top of whatever the repo documents, the Standards axis always carries the **smell baseline** below: a fixed set of Fowler code smells (_Refactoring_, ch.3) that applies even when a repo documents nothing. Two rules bind it:

- **The repo overrides.** A documented repo standard always wins; where it endorses something the baseline would flag, suppress the smell.
- **Always a judgement call.** Each smell is a labelled heuristic ("possible Feature Envy"), never a hard violation. Like any standard here, skip anything tooling already enforces.

Each smell reads *what it is* → *how to fix*; match it against the diff:

- **Mysterious Name**: a function, variable, or type whose name doesn't reveal what it does or holds. → rename it; if no honest name comes, the design's murky.
- **Duplicated Code**: the same logic shape appears in more than one hunk or file in the change. → extract the shared shape, call it from both.
- **Feature Envy**: a method that reaches into another object's data more than its own. → move the method onto the data it envies.
- **Data Clumps**: the same few fields or params keep travelling together (a type wanting to be born). → bundle them into one type, pass that.
- **Primitive Obsession**: a primitive or string standing in for a domain concept that deserves its own type. → give the concept its own small type.
- **Repeated Switches**: the same `switch`/`if`-cascade on the same type recurs across the change. → replace with polymorphism, or one map both sites share.
- **Shotgun Surgery**: one logical change forces scattered edits across many files in the diff. → gather what changes together into one module.
- **Divergent Change**: one file or module is edited for several unrelated reasons. → split so each module changes for one reason.
- **Speculative Generality**: abstraction, parameters, or hooks added for needs the spec doesn't have. → delete it; inline back until a real need shows.
- **Message Chains**: long `a.b().c().d()` navigation the caller shouldn't depend on. → hide the walk behind one method on the first object.
- **Middle Man**: a class or function that mostly just delegates onward. → cut it, call the real target direct.
- **Refused Bequest**: a subclass or implementer that ignores or overrides most of what it inherits. → drop the inheritance, use composition.

### 4. Run the eligible axes in parallel

For an initial review checkpoint, run both axes. For a bounded follow-up, run only the axis or axes that meet the follow-up rule in step 6. Never restart an unaffected axis.

**Standards sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The full diff command and commit list.
- The list of standards-source files you found in step 3, **plus the smell baseline from step 3** pasted in full (the sub-agent has no other access to it).
- The brief: "Report, per file/hunk where relevant, (a) every place the diff violates a documented standard: cite the standard (file + the rule); and (b) any baseline smell you spot: name it and quote the hunk. Distinguish hard violations from judgement calls: documented-standard breaches can be hard, but baseline smells are always judgement calls, and a documented repo standard overrides the baseline. Skip anything tooling enforces. Under 400 words."
- The boundary: "Perform this Standards review directly. Do not invoke `code-review` or spawn additional agents."

**Spec sub-agent prompt** should include:

- The diff command and commit list.
- The path or fetched contents of the spec.
- The brief: "Report: (a) requirements the spec asked for that are missing or partial; (b) behaviour in the diff that wasn't asked for (scope creep); (c) requirements that look implemented but where the implementation looks wrong. Quote the spec line for each finding. Under 400 words."
- The boundary: "Perform this Spec review directly. Do not invoke `code-review` or spawn additional agents."

If the spec is missing, skip the Spec sub-agent and note this in the final report.

### 5. Aggregate

Present the two reports under `## Standards` and `## Spec` headings, verbatim or lightly cleaned. Do **not** merge or rerank findings, because the two axes are deliberately separate (see _Why two axes_).

End with a one-line summary: total findings per axis, and the worst issue _within each axis_ (if any). Don't pick a single winner across axes: that's the reranking the separation exists to prevent.

### 6. Close the checkpoint

Treat every finding as a lead whose citation must be checked before a caller acts on it. Documented-standard violations and spec gaps can require a fix; baseline smells remain judgement calls.

A caller may apply the applicable findings in one **fix batch** and validate it. A fix batch is one logical batch and may span one or more commits. Those commits remain part of the same review checkpoint. The default is to stop there, not to rerun until the reports come back clean.

At most one consolidated follow-up may run per axis. An axis is eligible only when its own reviewer explicitly requests another pass or the fix batch materially changes that axis's inputs or conclusions. For Standards, that means the documented standards or smell assessment; for Spec, the required behaviour or spec criteria. Changes to a public interface, architecture, security, or a cross-cutting contract can affect either or both axes, but the category alone does not restart both. An edit confined to the cited finding is not material by itself.

If a follow-up finds another applicable issue, the caller may apply one final fix batch and validate it, then stops and reports any rejected, deferred, or residual findings. Any further review requires an explicit user request.

## Why two axes

A change can pass one axis and fail the other:

- Code that follows every standard but implements the wrong thing → **Standards pass, Spec fail.**
- Code that does exactly what the issue asked but breaks the project's conventions → **Spec pass, Standards fail.**

Reporting them separately stops one axis from masking the other.
