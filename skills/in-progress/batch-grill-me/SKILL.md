description: A relentless interview that asks every frontier question at once, round by round.
---

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Before asking each frontier, apply the `batch-grill-me` cadence in the [Codex-native user-input contract](../../../.agents/request-user-input.md).

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled — the questions you can ask *now* without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree — settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a *later* round, not this one.

Finding *facts* is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment, use the `orchestrate-agents` skill to dispatch a bounded, read-only fact-finding sidecar starting at `medium` effort with an isolated brief and no permission to spawn descendants. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so postpone only the dependent questions and ask the rest of the frontier now. If MultiAgent V2 is unavailable, look up the fact inline before asking the dependent question. The *decisions* are the user's — put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
